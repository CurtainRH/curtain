# Curtain ($CRTN)

Privacy system for Robinhood Chain (chain id `4663`). Shield USDG and
tokenized Stock Tokens, trade/lend/earn from behind the shield, prove
funds are clean without revealing your book.

Full spec lives in the root `docs/` (Overview, Backend, Implementation Build).
This repo follows the milestone sequence M0–M12 defined in the
Implementation Build doc — one milestone per PR, each with green tests.

## Stack

- **Contracts:** Foundry (Solidity 0.8.26)
- **Circuits:** circom 2.x + snarkjs (Groth16, BN254)
- **Backend:** Bun + Node/Express (TypeScript)
- **Data:** Postgres + Redis, hosted on Railway (no Supabase, no Timescale —
  time-series tables use plain partitioned Postgres instead)
- **Deploy target:** Railway (all services except GPU/TEE-based mobile
  proving, which lands in M8 and needs separate infra)

## Repo layout

```
contracts/    Foundry project — pool, gate, adapt, stealth, staking, etc.
circuits/     circom circuits — joinsplit, ppoi, solvency
packages/     sdk, recipes, verifier — shared TypeScript libraries
services/     broadcaster, ppoi-node, prover-assist, multiplier-view,
              solvency, indexer, api, status — independently deployable
apps/web/     wallet web app
infra/        deploy manifests, local dev config
docs/         project specs (Overview, Backend, Implementation Build)
```

## Local development

```bash
# 1. Start local Postgres + Redis (mirrors what Railway will host)
docker compose up -d

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install

# 3. Copy env template and fill in values
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Run tests
bun test                 # all TypeScript workspaces
cd contracts && forge test   # contracts
```
