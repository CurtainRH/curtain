Private swaps and stake-to-earn on Robinhood Chain. Swap USDG and tokenized Stock Tokens without a direct wallet-to-recipient edge, instantly or on a random delay you choose, with an escape hatch that returns your deposit if Curtain can't pay. Tagline: *Draw the curtain.*

## Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| Private swap | Deposit token X into the Curtain vault; token Y arrives at the address you choose. The vault does not store a direct deposit-to-recipient mapping, but public amounts can allow statistical correlation in low-volume batches. |
| Instant or delayed | Paid right away, or at a random time inside a window you pick (up to 180 days). The maximum delay is enforced by the operator service, not by the vault contract. |
| Escape hatch | If a swap isn't paid by its deadline, you can take your deposit back 3 minutes later. |
| Open keepers | Anyone can submit signed payouts and earn a small fee. |
| Stake-to-earn | Lock for 30 / 90 / 180 days to earn emissions at 1× / 1.5× / 2×. |
| Lending | Morpho integration, after launch. |

## How it works

1. **Intent:** the app asks the operator for a swap (output token, recipient, minimum output, delay). The user gets an escape ticket.
2. **Deposit:** the user deposits into `CurtainVault`. On-chain this shows only the deposit, not where it's going.
3. **Swap:** at the scheduled time, the operator batches deposits and swaps inside the vault through Uniswap.
4. **Payout:** the operator signs a payout; any keeper submits it. Recipient details are not stored in the deposit, although public amounts may be correlatable.
5. **Refund if needed:** after the deadline plus 3 minutes, an unpaid deposit can be refunded. The current V2 vault uses a 1-hour challenge window for already-paid deposits.

## Fees

| | Fee |
|---|---|
| Swap | 0.20% of the output |
| Keeper | 0.05% of the output (covers gas) |
| DEX | Uniswap pool fee |

## Getting started

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.4, [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh), and Docker (for local Postgres).

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CurtainRH/curtain.git
cd curtain

# Frontend
cp .env.example .env
bun install
bun run dev

# Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
bun install
bun run test                   # all tests, incl. e2e on a local anvil chain
cd contracts && forge test     # contracts
```

## Operator API

| Method | Path | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | `{ status }` |
| GET | `/config` | vault, tokens, keeper fee, max delay |
| POST | `/intents` | `{ id, deadline, salt, deadlineHash, vault }` |
| GET | `/intents/:id` | status, deposit id, output, payout tx |
| GET | `/payouts/pending` | signed payouts any keeper may submit |

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| MVP | Private swap (vault + operator + keepers), stake-to-earn, SDK |
| Launch | $CRTN token, deploy to Robinhood Chain, move admin/operator keys to multisig/MPC |
| After launch | Morpho lending |
